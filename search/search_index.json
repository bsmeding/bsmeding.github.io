Having a project-specific <code>ansible.cfg</code> in your project directory ensures consistent behavior for everyone working on the project.</p> <p>Why use ansible.cfg? - Centralizes configuration for your project - Avoids the need to pass extra flags on every command - Ensures reproducible and predictable automation</p> <p>Common settings: - <code>inventory</code>: Path to your inventory file - <code>roles_path</code>: Where Ansible looks for roles - <code>host_key_checking</code>: Disable SSH host key checking (useful for labs) - <code>retry_files_enabled</code>: Disable creation of retry files - <code>remote_user</code>: Default SSH user - <code>private_key_file</code>: Path to SSH private key - <code>timeout</code>: SSH connection timeout</p> <p>Example ansible.cfg: <pre><code>[defaults]\ninventory = inventory.yml\nroles_path = roles\nhost_key_checking = False\nretry_files_enabled = False\nremote_user = admin\nprivate_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa\ntimeout = 30\n</code></pre></p> <p>Tip: - Place your <code>ansible.cfg</code> in the root of your project directory. Ansible will automatically use it if present. - You can override any setting with command-line flags if needed.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ansible_tutorial_1_concepts/#ansible-playbook-structure","title":"Ansible Playbook Structure","text":"<p>A playbook is a YAML file describing automation tasks.</p> <p>Example playbook: <pre><code>---\n- name: Example Playbook\n  hosts: routers\n  gather_facts: no\n  tasks:\n    - name: Ping device\n      ansible.builtin.ping:\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ansible_tutorial_1_concepts/#host-and-group-variables","title":"Host and Group Variables","text":"<p>Variables can be set for groups or individual hosts using <code>group_vars/</code> and <code>host_vars/</code> directories.</p> <p>Example <code>group_vars/routers.yml</code>: <pre><code>ansible_user: admin\nansible_password: yourpass\nansible_network_os: ios\n</code></pre></p> <p>Example <code>host_vars/r1.yml</code>: <pre><code>ansible_host: 192.0.2.1\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"tutorials/ansible_tutorial_1_concepts/#ansible-facts","title":"Ansible Facts","text":"<p>Facts are variables automatically discovered about hosts.
