# Ansible role: Docker

This role, forked from [geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker), is the main role to install most of my other Docker container roles, I used the great role of `geerlingguy` and extended this role to serve some variables like `docker_uid` and `docker_gid` to the next roles so the container can run under the docker user.

All credits for this role are for `geerlingguy`
