# Docker Images

I maintain several Docker images, mostly to run Ansible CI/CD pipelines and network/infrastructure applications with enhancements for my daily work.

---

## Docker CI/CD Images

These images are designed for testing Ansible playbooks, roles, and more. They are based on various Linux distributions with Ansible and other packages pre-installed, mainly for **Network Automation** (NetDevOps). For each distro, there is a versionless image that always contains the latest release (e.g., `ansible_cicd_debian` is the same as `ansible_cicd_debian12`).

**Currently installed Python packages for network and CMDB testing:**
- ansible
- cryptography
- yamllint
- pynautobot
- pynetbox
- jmespath
- netaddr
- pywinrm
