# Docker images

I maintain a couple of Docker images, mostly to run Ansible CiCd pipelines and network/infra structure application with enhancements for my daily work

## Docker CiCd images

You can use this images to test Ansible playbooks, roles etc, the images are based on different Linux OS's with Ansible installed and some other packages mainly for `Network Automaiion` (`NetDevOps`)
