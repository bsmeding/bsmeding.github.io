# Introduction to NetDevOps

## What is NetDevOps?

NetDevOps is an approach that brings modern DevOps principles and practices to network operations. It aims to improve agility, automation, and collaboration in network management by leveraging tools and methodologies commonly used in software development.

In traditional network operations, changes are often manual, error-prone, and slow. NetDevOps introduces automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and version control to enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

## Key Principles of NetDevOps

1. **Automation**  
   - Automating repetitive tasks such as configuration management, testing, and deployment.
   - Reducing human errors and increasing operational efficiency.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Defining network infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
   - Popular tools include Ansible, Terraform, and Python.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
   - Implementing pipelines to validate and deploy network changes automatically.
   - Tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions are commonly used.

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Encouraging cross-functional collaboration between network engineers, developers, and operations teams.
   - Using version control systems like Git to track changes and facilitate teamwork.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback**  
   - Integrating telemetry and monitoring solutions to gain real-time insights into network performance.
   - Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and NetBox are frequently used.
