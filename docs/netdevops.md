# What is NetDevOps?

NetDevOps is an approach that brings modern DevOps principles and practices to network operations. It aims to improve agility, automation, and collaboration in network management by leveraging tools and methodologies commonly used in software development.

In traditional network operations, changes are often manual, error-prone, and slow. NetDevOps introduces automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and version control to enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

## Key Principles of NetDevOps

1. **Automation**  
   Automate repetitive tasks such as configuration management, testing, and deployment to reduce human errors and increase operational efficiency.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   Define network infrastructure using code for consistency and repeatability. Popular tools include Ansible, Terraform, and Python.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
   Implement pipelines to validate and deploy network changes automatically using tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
4. **Collaboration**  
   Foster cross-functional teamwork between network engineers, developers, and operations using version control systems like Git.
5. **Monitoring and Feedback**  
   Integrate telemetry and monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, NetBox) for real-time insights into network performance.

## Nautobot: The Single Source of Truth for Network Automation

Nautobot serves as a **single source of truth (SSoT)** for managing network infrastructure. It provides a centralized repository for device information, configuration management, compliance checks, automation, and vulnerability reporting. Nautobot can also synchronize with various third-party tools to enhance automation and management.

### How Nautobot Helps
- **Device Information:** Centralized inventory for quick and accurate access.
- **Pushing Configuration:** Automate deployment of network configurations.
- **Compliance Checks:** Ensure devices adhere to security and operational standards.
- **Automating Device Configuration:** Use playbooks and workflows for streamlined provisioning.
- **CVE Vulnerability Reports:** Gain insights into potential vulnerabilities.
- **Third-Party Synchronization:** Integrate with external systems for extended capabilities.

### Supported Third-Party Integrations
- Cisco ACI, Bootstrap, Citrix ADM, Arista CloudVision, Device42, Cisco DNA Center, Infoblox, IPFabric, Itential, LibreNMS, Cisco Meraki, ServiceNow, Slurpit, SolarWinds

By integrating Nautobot with these tools, organizations achieve greater visibility, operational efficiency, and automation capabilities.
