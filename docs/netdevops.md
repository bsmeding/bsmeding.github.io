# What is NetDevOps?

NetDevOps is an approach that brings modern DevOps principles and practices to network operations. It aims to improve agility, automation, and collaboration in network management by leveraging tools and methodologies commonly used in software development.

In traditional network operations, changes are often manual, error-prone, and slow. NetDevOps introduces automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and version control to enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

## Key Principles of NetDevOps

1. **Automation**  
   - Automating repetitive tasks such as configuration management, testing, and deployment.
   - Reducing human errors and increasing operational efficiency.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Defining network infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
   - Popular tools include Ansible, Terraform, and Python.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
   - Implementing pipelines to validate and deploy network changes automatically.
   - Tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions are commonly used.

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Encouraging cross-functional collaboration between network engineers, developers, and operations teams.
   - Using version control systems like Git to track changes and facilitate teamwork.

5. **Monitoring and Feedback**  
   - Integrating telemetry and monitoring solutions to gain real-time insights into network performance.
   - Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and NetBox are frequently used.

## Nautobot: The Single Source of Truth for Network Automation

Nautobot serves as a **single source of truth (SSoT)** application for managing network infrastructure. It provides a centralized repository for delivering device information, pushing configurations, performing compliance checks, automating device configuration, and generating vulnerability reports (CVE). Additionally, Nautobot can synchronize with various third-party tools to enhance network automation and management.

### How Nautobot Helps:

- **Delivering Device Information:** Stores comprehensive details about network devices, enabling quick and accurate access to inventory.
- **Pushing Configuration:** Automates deployment of network configurations across multiple devices.
- **Compliance Checks:** Ensures network devices adhere to security and operational standards.
- **Automating Device Configuration:** Uses playbooks and workflows to streamline device provisioning and management.
- **CVE Vulnerability Reports:** Provides insights into potential vulnerabilities affecting network devices.
- **Third-Party Synchronization:** Seamlessly integrates with numerous external systems to extend capabilities.

### Supported Third-Party Integrations:

- **Cisco ACI**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Citrix ADM**
- **Arista CloudVision**
- **Device42**
- **Cisco DNA Center**
- **Infoblox**
- **IPFabric**
- **Itential**
- **LibreNMS**
- **Cisco Meraki**
- **ServiceNow**
- **Slurpit**
- **SolarWinds**

By integrating Nautobot with these tools, organizations can achieve greater visibility, operational efficiency, and automation capabilities, helping them stay ahead in a rapidly evolving network environment.
