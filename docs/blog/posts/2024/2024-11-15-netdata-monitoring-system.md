## How to Install Netdata

### 1. Quick Start (One-Line Install)

The fastest way to get Netdata running on most Linux systems:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

- This script auto-detects your OS and installs Netdata as a service.
- After install, access the dashboard at: [http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999)

> **Security Tip:** Always review install scripts before running them in production.

### 2. Docker Deployment

Netdata is also available as a Docker container. **For best practice, mount all persistent data under `/opt/netdata/` on your host:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v /opt/netdata/config:/etc/netdata \
  -v /opt/netdata/lib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v /opt/netdata/cache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata
```

- This setup keeps all Netdata configuration, state, and cache files organized under `/opt/netdata/` on your host.
- Visit [http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999) after starting the container.
- For more options, see the [Netdata Docker docs](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/docker/).

> **Coming soon:** I will publish an [Ansible role](/ansible/ansible_role_netdata_docker/) to automate Netdata deployment with Docker as part of my [automation resources](/ansible_roles_and_collections/). Stay tuned!

### 3. Other Installation Methods

- [Kubernetes/Helm](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/helm/)
- [Debian/Ubuntu packages](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/apt/)
- [RPM packages](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/yum/)
- [Manual build](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/manual/)

## Basic Configuration

Netdata works out of the box, but you can customize it for your needs.

### Main Config File

- Location: `/opt/netdata/config/netdata.conf` (host) or `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` (in container)
- To edit:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /opt/netdata/config/netdata.conf
  ```
- Example: Change the default dashboard port
  ```ini
  [web]
    bind to = 0.0.0.0:19999
  ```

### Enable/Disable Plugins

- Netdata auto-detects most services, but you can enable/disable plugins in `/opt/netdata/config/netdata.conf` or in the `python.d` and `go.d` plugin directories under `/opt/netdata/config/`.
- Example: Enable the Nginx plugin
  ```bash
  sudo nano /opt/netdata/config/python.d/nginx.conf
  ```

## Monitoring Network Devices with SNMP and gRPC

Netdata can monitor network devices such as switches, routers, and firewalls using standard protocols like **SNMP** (Simple Network Management Protocol) and **gRPC**. This allows you to visualize interface statistics, CPU/memory usage, and more from your network infrastructure alongside your servers and containers.

### SNMP Monitoring

- **SNMP** is widely supported by network devices for exposing metrics.
- Netdata uses the `snmp` plugin to poll devices and display their data.
- Typical use cases: switches, routers, firewalls, printers, UPS devices, etc.

**Example SNMP configuration (`/opt/netdata/config/python.d/snmp.conf`):**

```yaml
switch1:
  community: public
  host: 192.168.1.10
  version: 2c
  modules:
    - system
    - interfaces
```

- After editing, restart Netdata: `sudo systemctl restart netdata` (or restart the container).
- See [Netdata SNMP docs](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/snmp/) for more details and module options.

### gRPC Monitoring

- **gRPC** is a modern, high-performance protocol used by some next-gen network devices and platforms.
- Netdata supports gRPC for certain integrations (see [Netdata gRPC docs](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/go.d.plugin/grpc/)).
- Example use cases: cloud-native network appliances, SDN controllers, or custom telemetry exporters.

**Example gRPC configuration (`/opt/netdata/config/go.d/grpc.conf`):**

```yaml
grpc_example:
  address: 192.168.1.20:50051
  metrics:
    - cpu
    - memory
```

- Adjust the address and metrics as needed for your device/platform.

## First Steps After Install

1. **Open the Dashboard:** Go to [http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999) in your browser.
2. **Explore Metrics:** Click through the charts for CPU, memory, disk, network, containers, and more.
3. **Set Up Alerts:** Netdata comes with built-in alerting. Configure notifications in `/etc/netdata/health_alarm_notify.conf`.
4. **Add More Nodes:** Use [Netdata Cloud](https://app.netdata.cloud/) (free tier available) to monitor multiple systems from a single dashboard.
   - **Note:** To use the Netdata Cloud dashboard, you need to create an online *space* (organization) in Netdata Cloud and link your nodes to it. This lets you manage and view all your systems in one place, invite team members, and access advanced features. [See the official guide](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/spaces/).

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Netdata not starting?** Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u netdata` or `docker logs netdata`
- **Firewall issues?** Ensure port 19999 is open.
- **Performance:** Netdata is lightweight, but you can tune data collection and retention in the config.
- **Security:** For public dashboards, use a reverse proxy with authentication.
