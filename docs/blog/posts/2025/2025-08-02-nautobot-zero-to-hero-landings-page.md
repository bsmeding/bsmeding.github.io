# Nautobot in Action â€“ Global Series Index

*A comprehensive guide to building a complete network automation solution with Nautobot, from zero to production-ready deployment.*

<!-- more -->

---

## Series Overview

This series takes you from a basic Nautobot installation to a fully automated network environment. You'll learn how to use Nautobot as your Single Source of Truth (SSoT), implement configuration management, ensure compliance, and build event-driven automation workflows.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Deploy and configure Nautobot with Git integration
- Onboard existing network devices automatically
- Implement Golden Config for compliance and drift detection
- Build remediation workflows for non-compliant devices
- Create event-driven automation for network changes
- Deploy new devices with Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP)
- Integrate with external tools via APIs

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Familiarity with Docker and Git
- A lab environment (Containerlab recommended)

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours across all parts
