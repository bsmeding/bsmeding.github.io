# APIs in Network Automation

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern network automation and integration. They allow tools, scripts, and platforms to communicate, exchange data, and automate tasks across diverse systems.

## Key Concepts
- **REST APIs:** The most common API style, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, etc.) and JSON data.
- **GraphQL APIs:** Flexible query language for getting exactly the data you need in one call.
- **gRPC and others:** High-performance, binary protocols for advanced use cases.
- **Authentication:** Most APIs require tokens, keys, or OAuth for secure access.

## Typical Use Cases
- Automating device configuration and provisioning
- Integrating inventory and monitoring tools
- Collecting metrics and logs
- Orchestrating workflows across platforms
