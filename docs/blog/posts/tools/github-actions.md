**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD and automation platform built into GitHub, allowing you to automate workflows for building, testing, and deploying code.

## Why Use GitHub Actions?
- Automate builds, tests, and deployments on GitHub
- Define workflows as code in `.github/workflows/*.yml`
- Integrate with marketplace actions and third-party services

## How GitHub Actions Works
- Workflows are triggered by events (push, PR, schedule, etc.)
- Jobs run in containers or VMs
- Steps use built-in or marketplace actions

## Quick Start Example
1. **Create a workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
   ```yaml
   name: CI
   on: [push]
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Run a one-line script
           run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
   ```
2. **Push to GitHub:**
   - The workflow runs automatically on push
3. **View workflow status:**
   - Go to your repoâ€™s **Actions** tab
