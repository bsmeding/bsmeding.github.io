# AWS CloudFormation: Introduction & Getting Started

**AWS CloudFormation** is an infrastructure as code (IaC) service that enables you to define and provision AWS resources using templates written in YAML or JSON.

## Why Use CloudFormation?
- Automate AWS infrastructure deployment
- Use version-controlled templates for repeatability
- Integrate with AWS services and CI/CD pipelines

## How CloudFormation Works
- Templates define resources and their relationships
- Stacks are deployed and managed via the AWS Console, CLI, or API
- Supports parameters, outputs, and resource dependencies

## Quick Start Example
1. **Write a simple template (`template.yaml`):**
   ```yaml
   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
   Resources:
     MyBucket:
       Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
   Outputs:
     BucketName:
       Value: !Ref MyBucket
   ```
2. **Deploy the stack (CLI):**
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-stack --template-body file://template.yaml
   ```
3. **Check the stack status:**
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-stack
   ```
