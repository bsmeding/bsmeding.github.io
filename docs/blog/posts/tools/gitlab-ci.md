**GitLab CI/CD** is a built-in continuous integration and delivery system in GitLab, enabling you to automate builds, tests, and deployments directly from your Git repository.

## Why Use GitLab CI/CD?
- Automate testing and deployment with every commit
- Define pipelines as code in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- Integrate with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers

## How GitLab CI/CD Works
- Pipelines are triggered by changes in your repository
- Jobs and stages are defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- Runners execute jobs on your infrastructure or in the cloud

## Quick Start Example
1. **Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` in your repo:**
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test

   build-job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - echo "Building..."

   test-job:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "Running tests..."
   ```
2. **Push to GitLab:**
   - The pipeline runs automatically on push
3. **View pipeline status:**
   - Go to your projectâ€™s **CI/CD > Pipelines** page
