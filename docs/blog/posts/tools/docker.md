# Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the leading platform for **containerization**â€”packaging applications and their dependencies into portable, consistent units. Docker is widely used in DevOps, automation, and cloud-native workflows.

## Key Features
- Build, run, and manage containers
- Portable and reproducible environments
- Docker Compose for multi-container apps
- Docker Hub for sharing images
- Integrates with CI/CD and orchestration tools (Kubernetes, etc.)

## Typical Use Cases
- Isolating and deploying applications
- Building automation and test environments
- Running network automation tools in containers
- Simplifying development and deployment pipelines
